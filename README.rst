Welcome to ``learn_aws`` Documentation
==============================================================================
This repository contains all of the AWS-related experience, study notes, example code, architecture diagrams, and other materials that are from my career experience 2011. There are so many AWS services. I have been an subject matter expert (SME) in approximately 100 different services, covering almost all areas of the IT industry. However, it's impossible for me keep those knowledge fresh. Therefore, I documented my AWS knowledge in simple language that allow people who have no AWS experience quickly get started, for the future me. This way, I can search the document and refresh my knowledge to an expert level in 15 to 30 minutes.

**这篇文档参照** `官网上 Products 一栏里的分类 <https://aws.amazon.com/>`_, **为每一类 AWS Services 都创建了子文件夹 (1 级目录), 子文件夹下的子文件夹 (2 级目录) 则是一个个具体的 AWS 服务. 例如 Compute (1 级目录) / EC2 (2 级目录)**. 在每个具体的服务的目录下, 通常最多再延伸出两级目录 (3 级目录 和 4级目录). 3 级目录通常是这个具体服务下的一些较大的话题, 例如常见的如何创建, 管理, 删除资源, 如何 Scale, 如何确保安全等. 而 4级目录则是大话题下的具体话题, 也是大多数的有干货内容的的文档所在的级别.
